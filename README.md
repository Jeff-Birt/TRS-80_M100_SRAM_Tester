# TRS-80_M100_SRAM_Tester
Uses an Arduino Mega to test TRS-80 SRAM modules.

Not only useful for the intended purpose but can also be used as a template for
building a test fixture for other devices. Demonstrates a basic user interface
using three push buttons and OLED display. Shows Ardunio Port/Pin manipualtion
done by abstracting the bit twiddling functions.

This is hardware released into the public domain.
